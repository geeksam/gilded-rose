General:

- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of (remaining)
  days we have to sell the item
- All items have a #quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item



Quality Constraints:

- The Quality of an item is never negative.
- The Quality of an item is never more than 50 (except "Sulfuras"; see below)



Current Behavior:

- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
- "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in
  Quality
- "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value
  approaches:
  - Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less
  - Quality increases by 3 when there are 5 days or less
  - Quality drops to 0 after the concert



      New Behavior:

      We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items.
      This requires an update to our system:

      - "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
